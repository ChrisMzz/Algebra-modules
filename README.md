# Algebra Python Library

Hi ! This is my personalised algebra python library. It contains every class relating to an algebraic method or concept that I've coded, mostly based on things I've seen in uni.

I'll update this library whenever I write something new, and possibly add more stuff if ever I deem that necessary.
