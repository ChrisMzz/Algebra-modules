# `algch` Detailed Algebra

algch is a package destined to elaborate on some computational methods of obtaining common results such as the determinant of a matrix (other things in the works). Includes as many tools as the author can handle making. Regular updates are planned, mostly to add tools and clear up some methods.
Uses the following packages, available for download on PyPI : `numpy`, `sympy`.

## Small description of contents

- `group` contains the following : Symmetric/Alternating Group of order n, Cyclic Group and Unit Group. Also supports Kronecker product.
- `equations` contains the following : Divisors of a number, used to generate a random diophantine equation and store its solutions for the user to practice methods of finding the solutions.
- `matrix` contains the following : Binomial Coefficients, Rectangular Matrix, Square Matrix, with method of finding its determinant, characteristic polynomial, and triangularisation (and diagonalisation if possible), with slight explanations whenever possible.

This is my first package so I'll try upgrading it when I can.
